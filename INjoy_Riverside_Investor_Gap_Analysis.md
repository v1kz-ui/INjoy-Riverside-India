# INjoy Riverside: Updated Investor Gap Analysis (v3)
**Date:** February 11, 2026
**Status:** Post-Pivot ("Real Estate First" + Kerala Pilots + Hospital Partners)

---

## 1. The "Tech Credibility" Gap (CLOSED)
**Previous Status:** High Risk (Vaporware).
**Current Status:** **Low Risk.**
*   **Fix Implemented:** Pilot programs launched in 2 sites in Kerala.
*   **Investor Takeaway:** "They aren't just building a building; they are gathering data *now*. The tech is real."
*   **Remaining Action:** **Document the Kerala pilot data.** Show screenshots of dashboards or anonymized patient data in the deck. Prove the sensors work.

## 2. The "Execution" Gap (Operational Void) (PARTIALLY CLOSED)
**Previous Status:** High Risk (Who runs the hospital?).
**Current Status:** **Medium Risk.**
*   **Fix Implemented:** "Hub & Spoke" partnership with Chandigarh multi-specialty hospitals.
*   **Remaining Gap:** **Hospitality Operations.** Who runs the "5-Star Resort" part? Is it in-house or a branding partner (e.g., Taj, Oberoi, or a specialized senior living operator)?
*   **Recommendation:** Name the Hospitality/Service partner or the key hire (GM with luxury resort experience).

## 3. The "Sales Velocity" Gap (Absorption Risk) (OPEN)
**Severity: High**
**The Issue:** Selling 495 Luxury Units in Ropar is a volume challenge.
*   **Current Narrative:** "Global Indian HNI."
*   **Missing Detail:** **Channel Strategy.** How specifically do we reach 495 NRIs?
    *   Is it Wealth Management referrals?
    *   Digital Marketing costs?
    *   Channel Partners (JLL/CBRE) commissions?
*   **Risk:** Without a defined channel strategy, customer acquisition costs (CAC) could eat the margin.

## 4. The "Valuation" Gap (Real Estate vs. Tech) (OPEN)
**Severity: Medium**
**The Issue:** Real Estate investors want safe returns (18-24% IRR). Tech investors want 10x multiples.
*   **Conflict:** By self-funding Tech from RE profits, we solve the *funding* source but confuse the *exit*.
*   **The Question:** Does the RE investor get equity in the Tech Co (InjoyOS)? or just the PropCo?
*   **Recommendation:** Clarify the "Spin-out" structure. "Investors in PropCo get pro-rata rights in TechCo Series A," etc.
